                <p class="header-text">
                    In 2015 England and Australia will contest the 69th Ashes series, Australia having won 32 of their previous encounters and England 31. Australia were most dominant between 1989 and 2002, when they snaffled eight series on the spin, while England won 11 of the first 12 contests, all of them in the 19th century. Over just the last 100 years Australia have a greater 25-16 lead but for all their sometime superiority, this cricketing rivalry remains red-hot.

                    In 2015 England and Australia will contest the 69th Ashes series, Australia having won 32 of their previous encounters and England 31. Australia enjoyed their greatest run of dominance between 1989 and 2002, when they snaffled eight series on the spin, while England are statistically buoyed by victory in 11 of the first 12 contests, all of them in the 19th century. Over the last 100 years Australia have a less wafer-thin 25-16 lead in Ashes victories, but for all Australia’s sometime superiority the countries’ cricketing rivalry remains red-hot.

England also had the most successful spinner, in the shape of John Emburey; Australia’s best of the time, though in terms of strike rate Australia’s Bruce Yardley was not far behind, averaging just one more delivery bowled per wicket taken</p>
